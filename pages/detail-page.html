    <h2>Monet</h2>
    <p>The relationship between Monet and the sea started soon as the young artist established, along with his family, in the coastal town of Le Havre, Normandy, in the mid-1850s. In these early years Monet did not feel an immediate attraction for the “plen air” painting, and he focused in creating caricatures of neighbors and acquaintances. But the young talent caught the attention of a painter who had established himself at Le Havre years earlier, Eugene Boudin, still considered one of the greatest seascape painters of the 19th century. After a few months, the master convinced the young artist to accompany him on his outings to paint outdoors. The tenacity of Boudin would not be in vain, and Monet recognized, several years later: "If I became a painter, it was thanks to Boudin"</p>
